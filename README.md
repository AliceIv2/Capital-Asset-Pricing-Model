## Project Overview 

In this project, we will use Python to perform stocks analysis such as calculating stock beta and expected returns using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). CAPM is one of the most important models in Finance and it describes the relationship between the expected return and risk of securities. We will analyze the performance of several companies such as Facebook, Netflix, Twitter and AT&T over the past 7 years. This project is crucial for investors who want to properly manage their portfolios, calculate expected returns, risks, visualize datasets, find useful patterns, and gain valuable insights. This project could be practically used for analyzing company stocks, indices or  currencies and performance of portfolio.


## Project tasks 

1. Understand the intuition behind Beta and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
2. Import datasets, libraries and perform exploratory data analysis
3. Perform Data Scaling/Normalization
4. Perform interactive data visualization
5. Develop a function to calculate daily returns
6. Calculate beta for individual security 
7. Apply CAPM to individual Security
8. Calculate Beta for the entire stocks in the portfolio
